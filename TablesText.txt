Load up on guns and bring your friends
Its fun to lose and to pretend
Shes over bored and self assured
Oh no I know a dirty word

Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello

With the lights out its less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us

A mulatto an albino
A mosquito my libido
Yeah hey yay

Im worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello

With the lights out its less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us

A mulatto an albino
A mosquito my libido
Yeah hey yay

And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard its hard to find
Oh well whatever nevermind

Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello

With the lights out its less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us

A mulatto an albino
A mosquito my libido
A denial
